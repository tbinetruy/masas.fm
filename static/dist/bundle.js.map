Please see our Cookies Policy for how to opt-out of those.\n\t\tPlease be aware that even if you opt out of interest-based ads, you may still see ads, which likely not be appealing to your interests.</p>\n\n\t\t<h3>Cookies</h3>\n\n\t\t<p>Information on how to block or disable cookies is included in our Cookies Policy.</p>\n\t\t<p>Further information is available athttp://aboutcookies.org.</p>\n\n\t\t<h3>App preferences</h3>\n\n\t\t<p>You can use the settings within your iOS device or within the Android app to opt-out of analytics tracking and bug reporting. For the opt-out, if you are using our iOS app, go to the settings of your iOS device and open the MASAS tab. With an Android device you need to open the MASAS app and open the basic settings tab within. From there you can simply disable analytics and/or bug reporting to stop any analytics data or bug reporting information being sent from the app.</p>\n\t\t<p>Further information is available in our Cookies Policy.</p>\n\n\t\t<h3>Deleting your account</h3>\n\n\t\t<p>You can delete your account in your Settings by hovering your profile picture (top right corner on Desktop website) or by expanding the main menu (top left corner on Mobile website). In your Settings, you will have the option to: \"Terminate Your Account\". Please bear in mind that, if you delete your account, all data associated with your account, including the sounds that you have uploaded and the usage data associated with those sounds, will be deleted and may not be recoverable.</p>\n\t\t<p>You are therefore advised to copy or back up all content uploaded to your account before you delete your account.</p>\n\t\t<p>Even if you delete your MASAS account, it is possible that your information may still show up in some internet search results for a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a temporary cache of web pages. Search engines' caching processes are outside of MASAS' control and therefore we cannot be responsible for any information that remains cached by search engines after that information has been removed from the Platform.</p>\n\t\t<p>Please note that deleting any MASAS Apps, or any third party apps to which your MASAS account is connected, will not delete your MASAS account.</p>\n\t\t<p> If you wish to delete your account, you will need to do so from the Settings tab in your main menu on the Website or the Apps. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that is connected to your MASAS account over our API, this will not necessarily delete all data from within that third party app. You will need to refer to the app provider’s terms of use and privacy policy to find out how to delete your data from that third party app.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<h2>Access to your data</h2>\n\n\t\t<p>As described above, most of the personal data and other information you provide to us can be accessed and updated in the Settings page of your MASAS account and on the Edit Profile on your profile page (top right-corner, little white pencil button). If you wish to access, amend or delete any other personal data we hold about you, or if you have any objection to the processing of any personal data that we hold about you, please contact us at:</p>\n\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li> privacy (@) MASAS.fm.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\n\t\t<p>If you ask us to delete your account (either via the Settings page or by email), we will do so within a reasonable period of time, but we may need to retain some of your personal data in order to satisfy our legal obligations, or where we have a legitimate reason for doing so.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<h2>International data transfers</h2>\n\n\n\t\t<p>MASAS is based in Europe, and your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared in accordance with European laws. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal data to the United States. You should be aware that privacy laws in the United States may not be equivalent to the laws in your country, and by using the Platform, you consent to the transfer, storage and processing of your personal data in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable law.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<h2>Children</h2>\n\n\n\t\t<p>MASAS is not intended for use by children. Anyone under the age of 13 is not permitted to use the Platform and must not attempt to register an account or submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from any person who is under the age of 13 or allow them to register an account. If it comes to our attention that we have collected personal data from a person under the age of 13, we will delete this information as quickly as possible. If you have reason to believe that we may have collected any such personal data, please notify us immediately at:</p>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li>privacy (@) MASAS.fm.</li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\n\n\n\t\t<h2>Changes and updates to this Privacy Policy</h2>\n\n\n\t\t<p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy, and when we do so, we will also revise the Effective Date set out below (Last Amended). Any changes to our Privacy Policy will always be available here so that MASAS's users are always aware of what information we gather, and how we might use and share that information. Please be sure to check back here from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy. Any material changes to this Privacy Policy will be communicated to registered users by a notification to their account and an email; so please, keep a valid email address.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<h2>Questions?</h2>\n\n\n\t\t<p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, want to suggest changes to this Privacy Policy or want to know, what information we store about you, please contact us by email at privacy (@) MASAS.fm.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<h2>Don't want to give us your information?</h2>\n\n\n\t\t<p>If you decide that you do not want us to use your information in the manner described in the Privacy Policy (including our Cookie Policy), please do not use the Platform. If you have already registered an account, you can delete it by going into the settings tab in our main menu and clicking \"Delete My Account\".</p>\n\n\n\t\t<h4>Emails used throughout this document:</h4>\n\n\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t<li><strong>privacy (@) MASAS.fm.</strong></li>\n\t\t</ul>\n\n\n\t\t<p>Last Amended: 07 September 2016</p>\n\n\n\t</div>\n)\n\nexport {\n\tPrivacy,\n}\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./static/js/components/Legals/Privacy.jsx","import React from 'react'\n\nconst ReportCopyright = props => (\n\t<div className=\"legals-content\">\n\t\tReportCopyright\n\t</div>\n)\n\nexport {\n\tReportCopyright,\n}\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./static/js/components/Legals/ReportCopyright.jsx","import React from 'react'\n\nconst Rest = props => (\n\t<div className=\"legals-content\">\n\t\t<h3>Welcome to</h3>\n\n\n\n\t\t\t<h2>MASAS - 'Make A Sound And Share' Cookie Policy</h2>\n\n\t\t\t<p>In common with most other websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to help us understand how our users, such as yourself, use MASAS,  so that we can keep improving the platform to meet your needs and exceed your expectations.
